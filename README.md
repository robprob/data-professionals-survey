# Data Cleaning
This data is sourced from a Data Professionals Survey created by [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx). Many thanks to Alex for publicly providing this data! I mostly used Python (pandas) and Power Query to prepare this dataset for exploratory analysis and dashboard creation. Much of my work was standardizing and consolidating the many free-form response questions to ensure the responses were correctly grouped.

# The Dashboard
This dashboard's primary focus is on the Education Levels and Salaries of Data Professionals across various demographics, including Country of Residence, Sex, and Race. I present how these factors affect pay in different regions and how challenging individuals found it to "Break into Data". The entire dashboard is completely customizable and interactive, allowing for filtering by any combination of such categories.

The example below demonstrates how the 79 Women who live in the United States appear to have slightly lower educational levels than other Women but earn much more than Women in other countries. These differences are particularly high for those who identify as "Asian", "Hispanic Or Latino", or "White". An interesting next step could be standardizing these incomes for the cost of living.
